# File naming
- lowercase
- `-` separated
---
On Windows I like to store data isolated from OS on separate **hardware** drive 

# Projects

- `. projects/`
    - `explores/` - i cloned to see explore shit inside editor
    - `tests/` - where i see how things works in micro temp projects
    - `samples/` - cloned shit that's looks like what inside explores but there are only actual *samples*
    - `pet/` - my shitty private code that will be in public in cyberpunk future
    - `<company or project>/` - projects related to one big thing
    - `scripts/` - micro stuff, usually just a bunch of files

# Docs
I like [these ideas](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/guides/how-to-organize-your-digital-files/) and [these](https://www.mindtools.com/ahjudzv/7-tips-for-effective-file-management)

On Windows I keep `docs` folder separated from `Documents` library as it gets cluttered by `Telegram Desktop` and sometimes other things. In this library I keep `temp` stuff.

- `. docs/`
    - `<project>/` - stuff that i'm working on
        - `resources/` - things belongs to project in general
        - `in-progress/` - these kind of files I have to name like "backup <date>" or "..._v1" etc.
        - `final/` - if `in-progress/` exists, here located the final most actual project documents
    - `obsidian-books/`    

# Programs
## Windows
- `. separate partiton for programs especially/`
    - `scoop/`
    - `nonportable/` - for programs that can't be managed by scoop and also for these program's related files
